* Make sure cygwin-mount-version is three nice integers separated by
  dots, as opposed to some interim thing like "1.4.6+".

* Check in.

* svn -m 'Preparing for version foo release' cp         \
  file:///home/erich/svn-repos/cm/trunk                 \
  file:///home/erich/svn-repos/cm/branches/whatever

* hack on the branch if needed.  Ensure the tests pass (try CVS Emacs
  too; I think I've seen it fail there).  Backport any hacks into
  trunk.

* svn -m 'Release version foo' mv                       \
  file:///home/erich/svn-repos/cm/branches/whatever     \
  file:///home/erich/svn-repos/cm/tags/whatever

* scp files from tag to http://www.blarg.net/~offby1/cygwin-mount/.
  Be sure that they're world-readable.

* Upload to http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/upload.pl ... although I
  would prefer that those guys *pull* from me, rather than me having
  to remember to *push* to them ...

* Send an announcement email to gnu-emacs-sources@gnu.org.  A nifty
  way to remember what you've done is
  contrib/client-side/svn_all_diffs.pl, in the subversion source tree.
